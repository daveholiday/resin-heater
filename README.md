A Project to warm the resin in an SLA 3d printer. 

12v Resin Vat Heater
====================
Reason:
-------

Formlabs heats the resin on their high end SLA resin printers.  It is known that most resins print faster when warm, and some not at all when cold.

Parts:
------
DC 12V Programmable Heating/Cooling Thermostat

Result:
-------
Keeping the temps at ~85f has seen more consistent printing. No failed prints since install, and possibly better aging of the FEP film. (lower viscosity resulting in less release stretch?) This method is likely more power efficient than the space heater designs seen elsewhere as the two heaters combined draw ~1a @ 12v. It also adds less heat to the surrounding room, important on hot summer days.
